// an <article> element, with the following elements inside:
// an <h3> element displaying the title of the article, passed as a prop called title

// a default value of "January 1, 1970" should be used if no date is passed as a prop
// a <p> element displaying the preview of the article, passed as a prop called preview

import React from "react";
